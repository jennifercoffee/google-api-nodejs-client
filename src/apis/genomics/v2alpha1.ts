 * @type object
 * @property {string[]} commands If specified, overrides the CMD specified in the container.  If the container also has an ENTRYPOINT the values are used as entrypoint arguments.  Otherwise, they are used as a command and arguments to run inside the container.
 * @property {string} entrypoint If specified, overrides the ENTRYPOINT specified in the container.
 * @property {object} environment The environment to pass into the container.  This environment is merged with any values specified in the Pipeline message.  These values overwrite any in the Pipeline message.  In addition to the values passed here, a few other values are automatically injected into the environment.  These cannot be hidden or overwritten.  `GOOGLE_PIPELINE_FAILED` will be set to &quot;1&quot; if the pipeline has failed because an action has exited with a non-zero status (and did not have the IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS flag set).  This can be used to determine if additional debug or logging actions should execute.  `GOOGLE_LAST_EXIT_STATUS` will be set to the exit status of the last non-background action that executed.  This can be used by workflow engine authors to determine whether an individual action has succeeded or failed.
 * @property {string[]} flags The set of flags to apply to this action.
 * @property {string} imageUri The URI to pull the container image from.  Note that all images referenced by actions in the pipeline are pulled before the first action runs.  If multiple actions reference the same image, it is only pulled once, ensuring that the same image is used for all actions in a single pipeline.
 * @property {object} labels Labels to associate with the action.  This field is provided to assist workflow engine authors in identifying actions (for example, to indicate what sort of action they perform: eg. localization, debugging, etc).  They are returned in the operation metadata but are otherwise ignored.
 * @property {genomics(v2alpha1).Mount[]} mounts A list of mounts to make available to the action.  In addition to the values specified here, every action has a special virtual disk mounted under /google that contains log files and other operational components.  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/google/logs&lt;/code&gt;: all logs written during the pipeline   execution are stored here.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/google/logs/output&lt;/code&gt;: the combined standard output and   standard error of all actions run as part of the pipeline   execution.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/google/logs/action/x/stdout&lt;/code&gt;: the complete contents of   each individual action&#39;s standard output&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/google/logs/action/x/stderr&lt;/code&gt;: the complete contents of   each individual action&#39;s standard error output&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
 * @property {string} name An optional name for the container.  The container hostname will be set to this name, making it useful for inter-container communication.  The name must contain only upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters and hypens and cannot start with a hypen.
 * @property {string} pidNamespace The PID namespace to run the action inside.  If unspecified, a separate isolated namespace is used.
 * @property {object} portMappings A map of container to host port mappings for this container.  Note that if the container already specifies exposed ports, the PUBLISH_EXPOSED_PORTS flag should be used instead.  The host port number must be less than 65536.  If it is zero, an unused random port is assigned.  To determine the resulting port number, consult the ContainerStartedEvent in the operation metadata.

/**

 * @property {integer} bootDiskSizeGb The size of the boot disk, in gigabytes. The boot disk must be large enough to accommodate all of the docker images from each action in the pipeline at the same time. If not specified, a small but reasonable default value is used.
 * @property {string} bootImage The host operating system image to use.  At present, only Container Optimized OS images may be used.  The default value is &quot;projects/cos-cloud/global/images/family/cos-stable&quot; which selects the latest stable release of Container Optimized OS.  This option is provided to allow testing against the beta release of the operating system to ensure that the new version does not interact negatively with production pipelines.  To test a pipeline against the beta release of COS, use the value &quot;projects/cos-cloud/global/images/family/cos-beta&quot;.
 * @property {string} cpuPlatform The CPU platform to request.  An instance based on a newer platform may be allocated but never one with less capabilities.  The value of this parameter must be a valid Compute Engine CPU platform name (such as &quot;Intel Skylake&quot;).  This parameter is only useful for carefully optimized work loads where the CPU platform has a significant impact.  For more information about the effect of this parameter, please visit https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform.
 * @property {genomics(v2alpha1).Disk[]} disks The list of disks to create and attach to the VM.
 * @property {object} labels Optional set of labels to apply to the VM and any attached disk resources. These labels must adhere to the name and value restrictions on VM labels imposed by Compute Engine.  These labels are applied at creation time to the VM and are applied on a best-effort basis to attached disk resources shortly after VM creation.
 * @property {string} machineType The machine type of the virtual machine to create.  Must be the short name of a standard machine type (such as &quot;n1-standard-1&quot;) or a custom machine type (such as &quot;custom-1-4096&quot;).
 * @property {genomics(v2alpha1).Network} network The VM network configuration.
 * @property {boolean} preemptible If true, allocate a preemptible VM.
 * @property {genomics(v2alpha1).ServiceAccount} serviceAccount The service account to install on the VM.  This account does not need any permissions other than those required by the pipeline.
